* Change the PropertyPanel to be more flexible (Only compatible with Java swing at the moment)
* Fix the GameWindow (Fullscreen mode is wonky)
* Test the packages (Need to test all of the functions in all the classes so a library bug doesn't ruin someone's project)
* Change the object that count down (Counter, Animation, etc.) to use milliseconds instead of frames.
